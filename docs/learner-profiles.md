# Learner Personas

## Anya Academic

1.  Biology professor at mid-sized state university;
    teaches undergrad microbiology and biostatistics classes,
    both of which emphasize data management and visualization.

2.  Used R for 15 years,
    switched to Python three years ago,
    but has never done "a real computer science course" (her phrasing).
    Frequently remixes teaching material she finds online, particularly examples.

3.  Wants to equip students with modern skills,
    but is concerned about tool setup and maintenance overheads.
    Doesn't have time to completely rewrite courses,
    so will only move over if there's an incremental migration path
    that allows her to back out if thing don't appear to be working.

4.  Anya's department has two overworked IT staff,
    and nothing at her university is allowed to go beyond the pilot phase
    if it doesn't integrate with the LMS.

## Nang Newbie

1.  Undergraduate business student;
    decided not to bother minoring in CS because
    "AI is going to eat all those jobs" (his phrasing).
    Nang chooses courses, tools, and interests based primarily on
    what the web tells him potential future employers are going to look for.
    He routinely uses ChatGPT for help with homework.

2.  Used Scratch in middle school and did one CS class in high school
    that covered HTML and a bit of Python,
    and got far enough to build a Wordle clone that almost worked.
    He just finished an intro stats class that used Pandas and Altair
    in hosted Jupyter notebooks.

3.  Nang enjoyed his intro stats class enough to sign up for the sequel.
    He wants to learn how to explore and analyze sports statistics
    as well as business data
    (he's a keen basketball fan).

4.  Nang is taking five courses and volunteering with two campus clubs
    (mostly for the sake of his CV),
    so he is always looking for corners to cut.

## Oliver Overstory

1.  GIS expert at a 100-person company that builds models of forest cover
    using satellite and drone imagery.
    "It's all about the maps." (his phrasing)

2.  Has been using Jupyter notebooks for several years for his own work
    and to build simple dashboards for other analysts at his company.

3.  Would like to turn what he's learned into a training course
    complete with an interactive textbook.
    Oliver realizes this is going to be a big investment,
    and wants to be sure he picks tomorrow's tools.
    (He recently migrated all his projects to uv, Pydantic, and DuckDB for this reason.)

4.  Oliver wrote his thesis with LaTeX
    and won't use tools that don't provide equivalent support for math,
    bibliography management,
    cross-referencing figures and tables,
    etc.
