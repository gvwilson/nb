- Uses it in his master's-level course (200-250 students/year) on bicycle engineering
  - Used to teach the same material to 15 students at a time
  - Shortage of teaching support resources
- Went Python -> IPython -> Notebook
  - Realized it would be a good way to combine symbolic algebra (for describing dynamics)
  - E.g., free-body diagrams -> vectors -> Newton-Euler equations
  - Teach students computer algebra instead of pencil on paper
- Students download chapters of his book as notebooks and execute themselves
  - Doesn't use "advanced" online stuff
- Gives them homework at notebooks
- Use Vocareum (online service built on JupyterLab) at TUDelft
- Use nbgrader for grading notebooks
  - 230 notebooks/week is infeasible by hand, so automate w/ nbgrader
- It's a challenge
  - Hand-grading engineering assignments allows flexibility (give students partial credit)
  - Applying nbgrader is restrictive
  - Has to think hard about how to grade intermediate portions
  - Not the fault of nbgrader per se, but of autograding in general
  - Doesn't have time to make grading algorithm more flexible
- Also uses nbgrader for exams
  - It becomes more all-or-nothing
  - Again, have to design exercises as layered
- How do students feel about autograding?
  - Like it for homework: re-submit until they get it right
    - Or they give up :-)
  - Don't like it in exams because higher stakes (higher stress)
- GVW explains reproducibility and "plays nicely with Git", asks if either are important
  - JM never had a problem with out-of-order execution
  - Doesn't understand how it's any different from just using an interpreter
  - Can see how tracking dependency graph would be a benefit
  - Tells students "just re-run notebook top to bottom"
  - His students don't use Git, so that's not a problem
  - JM is an experienced Git user, so it's not a problem for him
  - Doesn't use diff with notebooks: just treat as a linear update
  - Just open the two notebooks and inspect
- [discussion then turned to use of AI in teaching in general]
