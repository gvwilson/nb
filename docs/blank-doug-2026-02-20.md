- used to teach at Bryn Mawr, first installation of JupyterHub (2014-17)
- transitioned all his classes to Jupyter notebooks
  - wanted a data-oriented writing approach
  - Markdown + Google charting in a custom kernel
- left BM to join a company that built AI tools in 2017
  - Head of Research at Comet (comet.com)
- does not like Colab (first point he made)
  - they have a lot of cool stuff, but Google has diverged from standards and didn't give it back to Jupyter
  - Jupyter has tried to be polite about this, but it's been hard
- but finds himself having to use Colab
  - Comet uses Colab mostly for sending demo code with very little text
  - "here's a runnable example" - enter your API key and you're done
  - slideshow tool in Colab is painful, seems to have ignored what Jupyter did
  - DB struggled to figure out how to use it (despite years of experience)
- DB's rule was "every cell had to have explanatory text"
- if you give students a well-written notebook with blocks of code, students will just shift-enter through it
  - no interaction with their brain
  - so always make places where they can't continue (e.g. assert False) to force them to engage
  - want it to be hard enough that they can't zoom through on autopilot
- DB always told them "I want you to add cells", but failed: students mostly didn't
  - DB wanted them to explore, they just wanted to finish the assignment
- likes that Colab has their own language for creating widgets
  - create widgets inside comments
  - was terribly implemented
  - DB only used things that were Jupyter-compliant
- doesn't ever use the AI integrated into Colab
  - will it make student engagement even worse?
- Comet is transitioning to AI-only coding internally
  - human presence in pipeline is limited to just a few a spots
- how would he use AI with notebooks?
- DB's reply is "how do you teach with AI in general?"
  - need lessons that require incremental change (to prevent cheating)
  - e.g., bullet points and no upper case as first hand-in
  - can lessons be broken up that way?
  - don't bother trying to ask questions that AI can't answer, because moving goalposts
- AI often fails when a solution needs an abstraction layer
  - DB goes back and breaks the prompt into steps
  - teaching students what abstractions exist and are useful is important
- Catch-22: if students don't know the patterns they can't ask for them, but how do they learn those patterns?
- DB: class that taught him how to think about this was programming languages
- out-of-order execution was a minor problem for him when teaching (hidden state)
- mentioned Jupytext as a way to support diffs
- DB's colleagues did not like any pull request w/ .ipynb files
- Jeremy Howard / FastAI / Jupyter tools
- lots of praise for Allen Downey's notebooks
  - good stories
